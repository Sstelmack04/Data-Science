{"cells":[{"source":"![NYC Skyline](img/nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx` (Excel files).\n\nRecall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**datasets/airbnb_price.csv**\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n\n**datasets/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\nThis is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`description`**: listing description\n- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n\n**datasets/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\nThis is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed\n","metadata":{},"id":"a138556a-b9d3-4850-ba94-135e7f85f407","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Load the necessary packages\nsuppressMessages(library(dplyr)) # Do not change this line, as it is required to check your answer correctly\noptions(readr.show_types = FALSE) # Do not change this line, as it is required to check your answer correctly\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Import CSV for prices\nairbnb_price <- read_csv('data/airbnb_price.csv', show_col_types=FALSE)\n\n# Import TSV for room types\nairbnb_room_type <- read_excel('data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx')\n\n# Import Excel file for review dates\nairbnb_last_review <- read_tsv('data/airbnb_last_review.tsv', show_col_types=FALSE)\n\n# Join the three data frames together into one\nlistings <- airbnb_price %>%\n  inner_join(airbnb_room_type, by = \"listing_id\") %>%\n  inner_join(airbnb_last_review, by = \"listing_id\")\n\n# Question 1: What is the average listing price?
